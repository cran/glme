Description: Provides Generalized Inferences based on exact distributions and exact probability statements for mixed effect models, provided by such papers as Weerahandi and Yu (2020) <doi:10.1186/s40488-020-00105-w> under the widely used Compound Symmetric Covariance structure. The package returns the estimation of the coefficients in random and fixed part of the mixed models by generalized inference.
